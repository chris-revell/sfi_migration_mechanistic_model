This program is designed to be run in Python3. In Python2, a bug arises that causes .pop(0) to be applied to an empty list. This is because the division of t_max by the number of input data files gives a different result in Python2, leading to a different value for update_interval (essentially, itâ€™s the difference between integer division in python 2 and float division in python 3).
